 Reading global frequencies/wavelengths...
 Reading grid file and prepare grid tree...
 Reading star data...
 Note: Star 1 is taken to be a blackbody star
       at a temperature T = 35716. Kelvin
 Grid information (current status):
   We have 32768 branches, of which 32768 are actual grid cells.
   ---> 100.000% mem use for branches, and 100.000% mem use for actual cells.
   No grid refinement is active. The AMR tree is not allocated (this saves memor
 y).
 Reading the heat source spatial distribution...
 Beware: The OpenMP-parallel acceleration of RADMC-3D has 
         not yet been tested with all of the modes and
         features that RADMC-3D offers. Please check 
         your parallel results against the serial version
         (i.e. compiling without -fopenmp). 
 Reading dust data...
 Note: Opacity file dustkappa_sg-a10um.inp does not cover the 
       complete wavelength range of the model (i.e. the range
       in the file frequency.inp or wavelength_micron.inp).
       Range of model:     lambda = [ 0.10E-09, 0.11E+05]
       Range in this file: lambda = [ 0.10E+00, 0.20E+05]
       Simple extrapolations are used to extend this range.
 Reading dust densities...
 Dust mass total =    139.560095972700       Msun
 Using dust scattering mode            2
 Computing emissivity database...
 Computing total input luminosities...
 Modified Random Walk mode is switched OFF
  
 Starting the thermal Monte Carlo simulation....
